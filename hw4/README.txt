c) How to run:
    To run our program, simply run hw4_part1.m.

d) Details:

1. need hw4_world_and_obstacles_convex.txt and hw4_start_goal.txt as specified in the homework description.

2. we set our robot model to be a square of 0.35 meter.

3. reflection algorithm/convex hull algorithm:
	please refer to the ‘Grow Obstacles’ section in hw4_part1.m
4. Dijkstra algorithm:
	please refer to dijkstra.m
