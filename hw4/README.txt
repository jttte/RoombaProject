c) How to run:
    To run our program, simply run hw4_part1().

d) Details:

1. We need hw4_world_and_obstacles_convex.txt and hw4_start_goal.txt as specified in the homework description.

2. we set our robot model to be a square of 0.35 meter.

3. reflection algorithm: Please refer to the ‘Grow Obstacles’ section in hw4_part1.m, especially Obj_grow() function in hw4_part1.m.

4. convex hull algorithm: We implemented the Graham’s algorithm. Please refer to convex_hull.m and is_turn_left.m.

5. Dijkstra algorithm: Please refer to dijkstra.m

6. It takes about 5 seconds to run our program :( Please be patient. Thank you!
